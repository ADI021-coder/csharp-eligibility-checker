A rule-based C# console program that checks eligibility based on user age and height.
# Eligibility Checker (C#)

This console application checks whether a user is eligible to enter based on:

- Age
- Height

Both conditions are evaluated using logical and comparison operators.

## Concepts Used
- Console input/output
- Type conversion
- Logical AND (`&&`)
- Comparison operators
- Conditional branching

## Why this project?
The goal of this project was to practice combining multiple conditions in real-world style rules,
similar to access control or validation systems.

## Example Output
Enter your height: 165
Enter your age: 19
You can enter


## Notes
- Simple rule engine style logic
- No frameworks or external tools
- Built to improve decision-making flow in code
